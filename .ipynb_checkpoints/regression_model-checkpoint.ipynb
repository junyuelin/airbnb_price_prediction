The apt. is on the 11th floor of a 12 floor building so it's nice and sunny. The building has super friendly doormen, elevator service, and laundry in the basement. The whole apartment is yours, with the exception of some closet space and a dresser where I keep my belongings. There's a full kitchen at your fingertips, and laundry in the basement. I will leave my laundry card for your use but ask that you kindly reimburse me for its use (it's about $2 for the washer and another $2 for the dryer). I will not be present, though my two cats will be there. They are a very laid back little duo. One of them will certainly want to hang out with you and the other likely will hide atop the shelves. My neighbor will come by ev   \n",

It's less than 20 minutes by subway to the natural history museum, the metropolitan opera, and about 20 minutes to times square. In terms of nightlife it's best to head further downtown. I'd recommend the west village (30 minutes by subway), the east village (40 minutes), or Brooklyn (50 minutes).   \n",
